# Source folder

All the python source code has to live here. Source folder or `lib_template` in this case will be main module which will be converted in to package. There will be multiple sub-modules within this module. These sub-modules has to be by functionality. These are also logical bifurcation of the code. All the submodule should be as independent as possible. If there are common functionalities which has to be share across different sub-modules, then it can be part of module as utils or helper or shared assets. 

There will be tests folder in each sub-module. inside this tests folder there will be tests which are related to each sub module. in main module also, there will a tests folder. this will be testing the functionality of the module.

In root folder, there will be a tests folder. the purpose of this tests folder is to tests the functionality once the library has been developed.


Additional notes:

* There will be an `__init__.py` in each module and sub-module. All the functions has to be registered in this file.
* All the internal functions should start with `_` prefix. Any function `_` prefix should not expose.
* Logs will be generated by module and stored in the logs file.
* CLI app will be in main module folder.
* `__version__` from `__init__.py` is something which will track version of the library.
* `main.py` in the main module where all the high level APIs to be exposed by the module is managed.
